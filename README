CoffeeSync (csync.coffee) is a CoffeeScript program that uses zenity
to provide a GTK+ (GNOME) GUI for simple rsync backups.

The rsync options are currently hard-coded in the source.  Those
options specify that the source directory will be copied to the
destination using rsync's update algorithm to transfer only new files
and update files that exist on the destination to match the source.
Files that exist on the destination but are missing from the source
will be deleted if the --delete option is passed on the command line.

Syntax: csync source destination [--delete]


Requirements: 

CoffeeScript 0.94 or greater. (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
Node 0.30 or greater. (http://nodejs.org/)
zenity 2.32.0 or greater. (http://live.gnome.org/Zenity) Version probably not important.
